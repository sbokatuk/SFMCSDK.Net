# The SDK band is chosen by the *Android API level* in the target framework, not by the .NET
# version alone, because that is what decides which workload owns the runtime packs:
#
#   net8.0-android34.0  -> android 34.0.x, in the .NET 8 band
#   net9.0-android35.0  -> android 35.0.x, in the .NET 9 band
#   net10.0-android36.0 -> android 36.0.x, in the .NET 10 band
#
# The .NET 9 band compiles a net8 app happily - it has the API 34 *reference* packs - and then
# fails at packaging time with NETSDK1112, because it has no API 34 *runtime* packs and they
# cannot be restored from NuGet; they come from the workload. Note that the iOS runner does *not*
# do this - see the comment there.
